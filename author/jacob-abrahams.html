</footer><!-- /.post-info --><p>Occasionally, I like to take a step back and look at the programming languages I've used over the years. What better place to start than with my first, my last, my everything?</p>
<p>I've been programming Java since high school, and it was the first real language I was exposed to. I suspect that, when I sleep, I still type</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="n">public</span> <span class="k">static</span> <span class="kt">void</span> <span class="n">main</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">String</span><span class="p">[]</span> <span class="n">args</span><span class="p">)</span>
</pre></div>


<p>because it's <em>that</em> ingrained in my muscle memory. And you know what?</p>
<p>Java is an <em>awful</em> choice for a first language.</p>
<p>I'm not going to just state that, I'll give reasons:</p>
<ul>
<li>Java <em>requires</em> Object-Oriented Programming. Every java program is a function embedded in an object. Way to keep a gentle learning curve, there.</li>
<li>Java relies extensively on imports from other libraries, and other classes and types. That's so much to explain to a beginning programmer. Or not, which was the case with me: just don't explain anything, and just use it.</li>
<li>Java forces exception handling. Never mind that you're just starting out and probably don't even know what an exception is.</li>
<li>Java is garbage-collected, which means that you don't even know where things are going. <code>new</code> is just a keyword that makes things happen to you.</li>
<li>Java tends to use verbosity to the extreme: it makes simple tasks tedious, and complex tasks impossible.</li>
</ul>
<p>Probably think with Point 4 up there that I advocate C or C++ instead, right? Well, yes and no. I think that those languages are great for teaching a fledgling programmer that the program you write can do horrible, terrifying things if you fuck up, which can be great for traumatizing a freshman programmer into getting his/her shit together, or it can mess up their mind really badly. I also think that languages like Python are too high-level to make certain the programmer knows exactly what they're doing, relying on language constructs more than common sense. So, I'd actually like to see someone teach using C and Python <em>in combination</em>. (Though not in CPython, because that's really just the worst of both worlds.)</p>
<p>Anyway, this article isn't about ripping on Java as a choice of teaching language. It's about ripping on Java's design choices. Full disclosure from this point on: I actually write Java full-time, so I'm going to avoid writing my way out of a job.</p>
<p>Let's get down to it:</p>
<ul>
<li>Verbosity. Oh my <em>God</em> the verbosity. My fingers sometimes hurt after typing Java more than they'd hurt after an essay or a particularly long-winded blog post.</li>
<li>Strictness in file organization. A file named [Foo].java can only have one public class named [Foo]. If it's in a packaged called com.abba.jesus.pidgeot, then it's file path has to be <code>[something]/com/abba/jesus/pidgeot/Foo.java</code>, even if there's nothing in packages com, com.abba, or com.jesus.</li>
<li>Weird type-boxing/casting rules. Each of the value types is implicitly convertible to a related class in <code>java.util</code> (ie. <code>int</code> =&gt; <code>java.util.Integer</code>)...except as an argument to a generic class, where it has to be declared as the class rather than the value-type (ie. <code>List&lt;int&gt;</code> is a ParseException). This is fine (mostly), except that any function that takes a generic <code>T[]</code> has to have a <em>separate implementation for each value type</em>. Further, Java disallows casts between different class types (that aren't covariant)...except for a variable of <em>any</em> type <code>v</code>, <code>v + ""</code> is <em>always</em> a string and never results in a NullPointerException when <code>v</code> is <code>null</code>.</li>
<li>The weirdness of exception handling. Prior to Java 7, there was no way to handle multiple exceptions in a single block, leaving copious room for typos in copy-pasting the same damn block to both related handlers. Oh, and you have to handle every Exception, regardless of if it makes sense to...unless it's a RuntimeException. Then the JVM gives it a free pass. Why even <em>have</em> a duality? Why not just have stuff like that be handled as Errors or something?</li>
<li>Weirdly inconsistent library support. See <a href="http://tech.puredanger.com/2010/03/31/do-we-want-a-java-util-pair/">this article</a> on the concept of a Pair class, for instance. They basically say, "Oh I don't think it's necessary, so no one else will." I've also heard people say, "Programmers will use it wrong." That is a <em>terrible</em> reason not to support something, especially in a util class of all things. On that note...</li>
<li>Complete lack of operator overloading. Which would you rather see:
    <pre>
    BigInteger a = new BigInteger("12343212");
    BigInteger b = new BigInteger("234231999");
    BigInteger c = new BigInteger("65565790099");
    return c.add(b.muliply(a));
    </pre>
    or
    <pre>
    return c + (b * a);
    </pre>
    Again, the response seems to be, "People will use it wrong." And a lot of the time, the hatred is directed at C++, specifically the stream operator:
    <pre>
    int i;
    cin &gt;&gt; i;
    cout &lt;&lt; i &lt;&lt; endl;
    </pre></li>
</ul>
<p>To compare, let's discuss Scala, a language built on top of the JVM. Let's see what it does differently:</p>
<ul>
<li>Verbosity. Scala tends towards the succinct whenever possible, at least in my experience.</li>
<li>More free-form package organization. Scala will find your files, don't worry about what you name them. You can also put more than one top-level public class in a single file (though this is still discouraged)</li>
<li>More intuitive type-coercion. Scala's type system is complex. I don't know enough about lambda calculus to pretend I fully understand every part of it, but I do know they make value types <em>effectively just a different part of the standard hierarchy</em>. <code>List&lt;int&gt;</code> isn't a syntax problem anymore: it just works.</li>
<li>Free-form casting and conversions. Want <code>A</code> to always make sense as a <code>B</code>? Why not! You can do that.</li>
<li>No exceptions are forced to be checked anymore. Rejoice!</li>
<li>On the library support, it just tries to have as wide support as possible, which isn't always a good thing. (Want to know all of Scala? Too bad, that's what the internet's for.)</li>
<li>Operator overloading is just another function. This <em>maybe</em> goes a bit too far, since you can make operators using basically any character. (The <code>./</code> operator for fold-left is my favourite.)</li>
</ul>
<p>And, while we're at it, let's look at C#, a language made because Microsoft didn't want to be sued for using Java at one point[citation needed]:</p>
<ul>
<li>Still verbose, though I'd argue less so.</li>
<li>Package organization? Totally up to you. Hey, have 5 classes per file if you want.</li>
<li>A similar (though simpler) type system to Scala. Value types are <code>struct</code>s, everything else is an <code>obejct</code>, and <code>struct</code>s can be semantically treated like <code>object</code>s.</li>
<li>Define your own cast operators! Make them as explicit as you want! </li>
<li>Exceptions don't need to be checked. Funny how often this pops up...</li>
<li>A decent-ish standard library which supports most of the things you'd want. Maps that <em>actually</em> act the same as other iterables (as they damn-well should).</li>
<li>Override <em>only the existing operators and only within the definition  of the class itself</em> (ie, no overriding <code>int + int</code> or something). Humourously, the bit shift operators (ie. the straming operators in C++) can only have the second operand be an <code>int</code>, <em>because they're still pissed about that</em>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Don't take this to mean Java does everything wrong. The JVM is a great piece of technology, and the language has some neat constructs seen rarely elsewhere. (Anonymous interfaces, anyone?) But <em>so many</em> of its design decisions serve merely to act out of spite to the admittedly-overindulgent amount of freedom that C++ gives programmers. And spite is a <em>terrible</em> way to drive a design process. Scala, it seems, was designed out of counter-spite: it is <em>so</em> different from Java, yet is based on the exact same technology stack. In my mind, <em>Scala is the biggest "Fuck You" to Java that exists</em>. (C# only loses out on this because it's tied so tightly to Windows that it rarely sees the light of day outside of Microsoft developer pet-projects and ASP.NET-based websites.) And when a competitor springs up just to subvert everything you've done in an ironic way? Face it, Java, you've become the new C++. And not in a good way.</p>
<p>So there's my Java rant. It's been a long time coming. I'll probably dissect Python at some point, so if that interests you, tune in again.
'Til then, I'll be waiting for my code to compile.</p>
