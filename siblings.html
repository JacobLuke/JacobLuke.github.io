</footer><!-- /.post-info -->      <p>I write this on National Siblings' Day, not because I planned to, but because I couldn't <em>not</em>. My three siblings are everything to me, and I feel like it's the least I can do to dedicate a blog post to them. I know for a fact that, were it not for them, I wouldn't be where I am today.</p>
<h2>Leila</h2>
<p>[!leila.jgp]
Leila, I know you're only two. I know I haven't been around for much of your life, and I know there are times you've forgotten I exist. These are just realities when your brother needs to work and go to school, and doesn't like to do either of those close to home.</p>
<p>But it doesn't matter. By the second week I was home, you had conscripted me as your Walking Assistant, there to hold your hand as you walked up and down the hall, even though you didn't really need it. You treated me like family barely knowing who I was. You started saying "Hey" to me every time you saw me. And shortly after I left again, you learned my name. You reminded me that good changes still happen in the world at a time when I'd (understandably) pushed that idea aside. </p>
<p>You may grow up (and you do seem to do so rather fast), but to me you'll always be that little girl with an impossibly big heart.</p>
<h2>Noah</h2>
<p>[!noah.jpg]
When I first saw you in the hospital, I honestly thought you looked more like an alien than a little boy, cute though you were. Before one month had passed, though, I knew I would give anything to keep that little space creature safe from harm, no matter what.</p>
<p>I stood by your side as you grew from that little helpless blob to a little boy. I kept an eye on you all those days as your mom ran the daycare. I listened to your Noahspeak when others were too busy to. I held you on my shoulders for endless blocks, I walked and ran beside you as you went, and I always tried to be there to catch you when you fell.</p>
<p>Who would have thought you'd ever need to be there to catch me?</p>
<p>When you saw me that first morning I was back, you ran up to me and gave me a big strong hug. It was then, with your tiny arms embracing me, that I started to see that someday, maybe not for a while but definitely eventually, everything would be alright again. You showed wisdom and kindness not usually attributed to a 5 year-old, understanding what had happened much more deeply than it had been explained to you. You stood by my side as I had always stood by yours, and kept everyone entertained in your usual way, dancing and singing to lighten spirits when it seemed most grim. I hope I never have to be there for you the way you were for me, and nothing of the same calibre happens to you, but I will always be your brother, and your friend.</p>
<h2>Emily</h2>
<p>[!emily and me.jpg]
Emily, you've been with me my whole life. I know we used to fight a lot as kids, and then as teens, but, when push came to shove, we'd always have each other's backs. I always knew that you'd be the one person I could count on in my corner no matter what, and you'd always be there for advice, someone to talk to, or someone to lean on when I needed it most. And I wasn't wrong.</p>
<p>When I had nowhere else to turn, you gave me your <em>apartment</em> for over a month. You took time out of your extremely busy workday to help me make appointments and organize logistics. You helped me stand when I couldn't, and stayed by my side when I could, just in case I stumbled. You kept me moving, kept me steady, and kept me alive. I'm so lucky to have you for a sister, and I'll never forget what you've done for me. You reminded me why I looked up to you for those years, why I still do, and why I will always be proud to call myself your brother.</p>
<h2>Coda</h2>
<p>I know only one of the three of you reads this blog (and, in truth, only two of you can read). I don't know if you will all even ever read these words, and I don't know if I intend for you to, honestly. I just hope I can remind you, and anyone else who reads this, what a true sibling is, because that's what you all are to me. Without the support of the three of you, I wouldn't have weathered the storm the way I did. Without Emily's steady stream of support, Noah's anchoring bonds, and Leila's ever-expanding personality, I wouldn't be who I am today. Thank you all.</p>
<p>Now go hug your siblings</p>
<p>J</p>
