</footer><!-- /.post-info -->      <p>So I got an interesting response out of my last article. I'm not going to lie, it wasn't the easiest thing in the world to write, and it's kind of gratifying that it didn't fall on deaf ears. I got some great advice in exchange for the words I gave, and a lot of stories I obviously won't talk about at length. Sometimes it's nice to feel like you're not going at something alone.</p>
<p>On the advice of my good friend <a href="http://sandymaguire.me/">Sandy</a>, I decided to quantify my motivators using a technique called <a href="http://sandymaguire.me/goal-factoring/">goal-factoring</a>. He's got an explanation there that's way better than anything I could come up with, but I'll make an attempt:</p>
<ul>
<li>Start by brainstorming your day-to-day activities. Ideally, this includess any conscious action, but if you can't remember something it's probably not going to factor in too much anyway</li>
<li>For each activity, ask yourself <em>why</em> you do it. Sometimes this makes sense, sometimes it doesn't, but don't stop thinking about it until you come up with at least one cause. In my case, I tried to generalize causes a little at this step to make the map cleaner, but you don't have to</li>
<li>Until you reach an obvious base level (eg. an emotion, a physical necessity), repeat with remaining roots from the previous step. You can update nodes to point to more base causes as necessary.</li>
</ul>
<p>He ends up with a chart that (from low-resolution) looks like this:</p>
<p><img alt="Goal-factoring Chart" src="/goalfactoring.jpg" title="Goal-Factoring Chart" /></p>
<p>After drawing up my version of the process, I realized it wouldn't make as much sense as a chart for me for 2 reasons:
  * I can't draw. LaTeX? Still won't be readable (somehow). Some other charting software? Ain't nobody got time for that.
  * Mine turns out <em>so damn linear</em> that it's a very simple ranking.</p>
<p>What do I mean by linear? Well it's simple: I came up with some 7 reasons why I do around 20 things I do. Out of these 7, 4 were linear compositions of the other 3. Out of the remaining 3, I could pinpoint some combination of 3 basic emotions. Then I stopped, because, as I said, there isn't much further to go from there, and the mathy part of me realized I'd found what amounted to the rank of my emotional matrix, so I probably wouldn't make further headway anyway.</p>
<p>But then I ran into an issue: <em>what should I do with this information?</em> I had no idea how to combine some vague sense of self-realization with a desire to write, a personal website, and so much unused creative energy. I thought long and hard on the issue, deliberated for hours, and...</p>
<p>Just kidding. The moment I stopped writing out the list, I started thinking through the blog entries. This will be the first of three (if I'm lucky), and simultaneously the most and least upbeat. So here we go.</p>
<h2>Pride</h2>
<p>Pride gets a bad rap. It's one of the deadly sins. It's associated with conceit, vanity, and self-interest. If you believe Quentin Tarantino, "Pride only hurts. It never helps."</p>
<p>It also makes it possible to define yourself.</p>
<p>Let me explain with an anecdote of sorts. Back in high school, I used to get around mostly by bike. (I still do, but I used to too.) By Grade 12, I had my route down perfectly: down along the lakeshore for about 7 km, then up one of the steepest hills in the city, then around 2 km more to my school's front entrance. It was a great path, stayed off the road for as long as possible, and had huge benefits for strength and cardio built right in.</p>
<p>The waterfront was the hardest part. Large bodies of water tend to generate large air currents from convection, which means shorelines tend to be windy. Add in the fact that Lake Ontario is by no means small, and you get one hell of a windy bike ride. Most curiously, no matter what time I left and in which direction I was headed, the wind usually seemed to be <em>against me</em>. So what did I do? Simple. I biked <em>harder</em>. It became so frequent that every time I felt a blast of wind along Lakeshore Boulevard West, I muttered under my breath:</p>
<p>Bring it on, motherfucker.</p>
<p>See, biking is something that I'd used to <em>define</em> me. If I knew more philosophy, I'd say I considered biking to be <em>essential</em> to my person. I claimed that route and made it mine. No one did it better. And no wind got in my way. Not backing down became vital to who I was, integrated firmly with my identity.</p>
<p>That's the kind of pride I mean. Not the harmful, get-in-your-way kind, but the kind that turns a simple activity like biking a short distance as fast as possible into a defense of your sense of self. The kind of feeling you get that makes you think, "I can't fail at this because it is not in my nature. <em>That is not who I am</em>."</p>
<p>You may still notice a problem.</p>
<p>This kind of pride can screw you over if you do end up failing at something you treasure. Suddenly, you're without part of your identity, and you don't know how to fix that. I'm going to go ahead and push my anecdote as far as I can to give you some tips on that:</p>
<ul>
<li>Pick your battles. I cannot stress this enough. Sure, biking into the wind made me feel validated because I could do it. But as it got colder? As the wind became less of a gentle, competitive shove and more of a threat on my life? As the streets iced up and the mornings grew dark? I stopped. I put my bike in the shed (<em>cough</em> hallway <em>coug</em>) for the winter and went into my yearly trading-coffee-for-morning-rides phase. I knew I couldn't win against the elements, and, besides, I biked first and foremost because it made me feel <em>alive</em>. Dying in the process wouldn't help anything.</li>
<li>Remind yourself periodically who's in charge. I have some rules about biking, like I try not to bike in the rain, and I avoid biking when I know I'll be out long after dark. Really, though, I just take a break from it every once in a while to remind me that I <em>chose</em> to make it part of me, not the other way around. Remember, above all else, <em>you define you</em>.</li>
</ul>
<p>To sum up, let it drive you but keep your foot above the brake and your hands over the steering wheel (like you would with a self-driving car). And when you feel that gust pushing at you the exact moment you were starting to tire, lower your head, grin, and say:</p>
<p>Bring it on, motherfucker.</p>
