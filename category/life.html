</footer><!-- /.post-info --><p>(Note: this post was delayed for a few reasons, not the least of which was a desperately needed rewrite.)</p>
<p>For those keeping track at home, this is Part 2 of the series I started <a href="/pride.html">here</a>. In its way, it's also Part 1 (of 3, I think) of a subseries inside the series based on a common theme. Yes, this is confusing, and yes, this adds up to 4 instead of 3 (as previously stated). If you look at the revision history on Github, the page actually said 4 for a while, which I changed once when planning things and won't change back because <em>stop telling me what to do</em>. Now if you don't mind, let's get to the actual content...</p>
<p>I'd originally planned for this article to focus on respect, which is a pretty amorphous and vague term in a lot of ways. Respect for whom? How are you showing it? To what extent? Most importantly, <em>why</em> are you showing respect? If you combine all the possible combinations of answers, you get...well, way more topics than I have energy to write about. Knowing my SQL, I decided to <code>GROUP BY target</code>, because it flows nicely. (I'm aware you wouldn't put this information into a database. Stop nitpicking.)</p>
<h2>You</h2>
<p>We'll start off with the person you know best: you. Without exception, you're the person you spend the most time with. You've also known you since before kindergarten, you've grown up with you, you've seen you naked, and (barring unforseen circumstances) you'll grow old with you. If you have to put up with you all this time, why not at least pay you <em>some</em> respect? I'll explain how:</p>
<p>There is a person you deserve to be.</p>
<p>Don't think for a second that I mean you're entitled to higher pay (though you might be), or to win the lottery (though you might), or to violate physical laws (you won't). I mean, every person is a collection of values, experiences, and brain chemistry that make up what they are. These reflect in our personality and actions, which in turn affect all of them in this beautiful feedback loop.</p>
<p>And there's no reason not to make the person you deserve better.</p>
<p>A month ago or so, I was wondering how I was still standing. I could let circumstances take over. I could yield to my condition. I could put up all my old walls and shells and seal everything away. There were so many ways I could put things together and come out with a wrong result.</p>
<p>But I didn't. I kept moving, because despite it all I'd <em>earned</em> the characteristics I'd needed to keep going. I'd earned the strength to go on from putting up with everything for so many years. I'd earned the tricks and hotfixes I use with the years I'd invested in developing them. I'd earned the emotional openness by making it through the most emotionally raw period in my life more-or-less intact. And I couldn't throw that effort, that investment, that <em>self-dedication</em>, away. Because I <em>deserve</em> to be someone who got through it all. I have to keep trying to <a href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EarnYourHappyEnding">earn my happy ending</a>, not because I'm an optimist, not because I have any reason to believe everything will be alright, but because it's what I deserve to do.</p>
<p>And you know what? It's what you deserve too.</p>
