Previous posts &lt;a href="pride.html"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="respect-1.html"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'll admit I'm self-reliant to a fault. Take, for example, the earlier two parts of this series. The first was all about relying on your self-image to find purpose, basing your strength in your own identity. The second was about doing justice to your own experiences, allowing you to draw power from your own deserved characteristics. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It sounds great in theory, but I've found (on multiple occasions) that independence and self-isolation go hand in hand, making me less likely to reach out in times of need. Starting this blog, admittedly, was an attempt to break from that: my &lt;a href="failsafes.html"&gt;first real article&lt;/a&gt; is kind of transparent in hindsight about its true intentions. I kind of wish I'd kept that spirit up, but sometimes old habits are easier. It's often simplest to think you're the only thing riding on your decisions, pruning goals down to a clear objective and reducing the weight of success and failure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But it's never true.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just like you owe your own life experiences due diligence, you have a duty to those who care for you to thrive, to make your life the best you can. They've invested what they could, and they all deserve the dividends you can provide. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don't mean to say that others should live your life for you, or make your choices on your behalf, or ever push you to do something you don't think you should. Hell no. Make your own damn life, it's the only one you'll get. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the same time, though, remember all the people who've taken stake in you. Every person who's said, "That guy. I think he'll do okay, and I'll help make sure." Every person who stood by you, with you, or for you. Every person who cleaned your wounds, visible or not. Every person who put their faith in you at a time where nothing mattered more. You owe them something. Not money, not children, not the blood of your enemies. You don't even owe them success, fame, or fortune. You just owe them one thing: when everything gets rough, you hold on just a little longer. You stand just a few seconds more when the storm hits, keep the levees together for just a few more moments for the brick and mortar they gave you to build them. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And maybe, just maybe, they make the difference, and you keep running when you should have stumbled and fell. When you have no right to survival, you thrive. When you couldn't possibly imagine going on another week, another day, another &lt;em&gt;hour&lt;/em&gt;, you do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And you never forget why.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;J&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Postscript&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'd originally intended for this article to focus on empathy, all those months ago when I conceived it. The main message was the same, of course, but the delivery was &lt;em&gt;totally&lt;/em&gt; different. It was mostly about pain transference, about the multiplier you'd apply to your own suffering to pass it off to someone else. It was something that often went through my head at my darker moments, for reasons that are left as an exercise to the reader. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It helped a &lt;em&gt;lot&lt;/em&gt; (more than any other CBT-like thought process has in ages), but I realized something when writing the first draft of this article: it was very &lt;em&gt;me&lt;/em&gt;. It's not like it could &lt;em&gt;never&lt;/em&gt; help someone else, (hell, none of my experiences are wholly unique) but it certainly limited my scope immensely. So I retooled. And retooled. And retooled. And eventually wrote an article that you probably just read. It's different, but it gets the same message across (more or less) without losing the effect (I hope) or being inaccessible to people who haven't been in a state like I was.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><category term="heavy"></category><category term="mental health"></category></entry><entry><title>Siblings</title><link href="http://jabrahams.ca/siblings.html" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2014-04-10T00:00:00Z</updated><author><name>Jacob Abrahams</name></author><id>tag:jabrahams.ca,2014-04-10:siblings.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;I write this on National Siblings' Day, not because I planned to, but because I couldn't &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt;. My three siblings are everything to me, and I feel like it's the least I can do to dedicate a blog post to them. I know for a fact that, were it not for them, I wouldn't be where I am today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Leila&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Leila" src="leila.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Leila, I know you're only two. I know I haven't been around for much of your life, and I know there are times you've forgotten I exist. These are just realities when your brother needs to work and go to school, and doesn't like to do either of those close to home.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But it doesn't matter. By the second week I was home, you had conscripted me as your Walking Assistant, there to hold your hand as you walked up and down the hall, even though you didn't really need it. You treated me like family barely knowing who I was. You started saying "Hey" to me every time you saw me. And shortly after I left again, you learned my name. You reminded me that good changes still happen in the world at a time when I'd (understandably) pushed that idea aside. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You may grow up (and you do seem to do so rather fast), but to me you'll always be that little girl with an impossibly big heart.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Noah&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Noah" src="noah.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I first saw you in the hospital, I honestly thought you looked more like an alien than a little boy, cute though you were. Before one month had passed, though, I knew I would give anything to keep that little space creature safe from harm, no matter what.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I stood by your side as you grew from that little helpless blob to a little boy. I kept an eye on you all those days as your mom ran the daycare. I listened to your Noahspeak when others were too busy to. I held you on my shoulders for endless blocks, I walked and ran beside you as you went, and I always tried to be there to catch you when you fell.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Who would have thought you'd ever need to be there to catch me?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you saw me that first morning I was back, you ran up to me and gave me a big strong hug. It was then, with your tiny arms embracing me, that I started to see that someday, maybe not for a while but definitely eventually, everything would be alright again. You showed wisdom and kindness not usually attributed to a 5 year-old, understanding what had happened much more deeply than it had been explained to you. You stood by my side as I had always stood by yours, and kept everyone entertained in your usual way, dancing and singing to lighten spirits when it seemed most grim. I hope I never have to be there for you the way you were for me, and nothing of the same calibre happens to you, but I will always be your brother, and your friend.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Emily&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Emily" src="emily_and_me.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Emily, you've been with me my whole life. I know we used to fight a lot as kids, and then as teens, but, when push came to shove, we'd always have each other's backs. I always knew that you'd be the one person I could count on in my corner no matter what, and you'd always be there for advice, someone to talk to, or someone to lean on when I needed it most. And I wasn't wrong.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I had nowhere else to turn, you gave me your &lt;em&gt;apartment&lt;/em&gt; for over a month. You took time out of your extremely busy workday to help me make appointments and organize logistics. You helped me stand when I couldn't, and stayed by my side when I could, just in case I stumbled. You kept me moving, kept me steady, and kept me alive. I'm so lucky to have you for a sister, and I'll never forget what you've done for me. You reminded me why I looked up to you for those years, why I still do, and why I will always be proud to call myself your brother.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Coda&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I know only one of the three of you reads this blog (and, in truth, only two of you can read). I don't know if you will all even ever read these words, and I don't know if I intend for you to, honestly. I just hope I can remind you, and anyone else who reads this, what a true sibling is, because that's what you all are to me. Without the support of the three of you, I wouldn't have weathered the storm the way I did. Without Emily's steady stream of support, Noah's anchoring bonds, and Leila's ever-expanding personality, I wouldn't be who I am today. Thank you all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now go hug your siblings&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For those keeping track at home, this is Part 2 of the series I started &lt;a href="/pride.html"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. In its way, it's also Part 1 (of 3, I think) of a subseries inside the series based on a common theme. Yes, this is confusing, and yes, this adds up to 4 instead of 3 (as previously stated). If you look at the revision history on Github, the page actually said 4 for a while, which I changed once when planning things and won't change back because &lt;em&gt;stop telling me what to do&lt;/em&gt;. Now if you don't mind, let's get to the actual content...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'd originally planned for this article to focus on respect, which is a pretty amorphous and vague term in a lot of ways. Respect for whom? How are you showing it? To what extent? Most importantly, &lt;em&gt;why&lt;/em&gt; are you showing respect? If you combine all the possible combinations of answers, you get...well, way more topics than I have energy to write about. Knowing my SQL, I decided to &lt;code&gt;GROUP BY target&lt;/code&gt;, because it flows nicely. (I'm aware you wouldn't put this information into a database. Stop nitpicking.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;You&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We'll start off with the person you know best: you. Without exception, you're the person you spend the most time with. You've also known you since before kindergarten, you've grown up with you, you've seen you naked, and (barring unforseen circumstances) you'll grow old with you. If you have to put up with you all this time, why not at least pay you &lt;em&gt;some&lt;/em&gt; respect? I'll explain how:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is a person you deserve to be.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Don't think for a second that I mean you're entitled to higher pay (though you might be), or to win the lottery (though you might), or to violate physical laws (you won't). I mean, every person is a collection of values, experiences, and brain chemistry that make up what they are. These reflect in our personality and actions, which in turn affect all of them in this beautiful feedback loop.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And there's no reason not to make the person you deserve better.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A month ago or so, I was wondering how I was still standing. I could let circumstances take over. I could yield to my condition. I could put up all my old walls and shells and seal everything away. There were so many ways I could put things together and come out with a wrong result.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But I didn't. I kept moving, because despite it all I'd &lt;em&gt;earned&lt;/em&gt; the characteristics I'd needed to keep going. I'd earned the strength to go on from putting up with everything for so many years. I'd earned the tricks and hotfixes I use with the years I'd invested in developing them. I'd earned the emotional openness by making it through the most emotionally raw period in my life more-or-less intact. And I couldn't throw that effort, that investment, that &lt;em&gt;self-dedication&lt;/em&gt;, away. Because I &lt;em&gt;deserve&lt;/em&gt; to be someone who got through it all. I have to keep trying to &lt;a href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EarnYourHappyEnding"&gt;earn my happy ending&lt;/a&gt;, not because I'm an optimist, not because I have any reason to believe everything will be alright, but because it's what I deserve to do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And you know what? It's what you deserve too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;J&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There's a life out there&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And it's gonna be mine&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;-- &lt;cite&gt;Train&lt;/cite&gt; (3 Doors Down)&lt;/p&gt;</summary><category term="mental health"></category><category term="heavy"></category></entry><entry><title>Pride and Self-Image</title><link href="http://jabrahams.ca/pride.html" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2014-03-14T00:00:00Z</updated><author><name>Jacob Abrahams</name></author><id>tag:jabrahams.ca,2014-03-14:pride.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;So I got an interesting response out of my last article. I'm not going to lie, it wasn't the easiest thing in the world to write, and it's kind of gratifying that it didn't fall on deaf ears. I got some great advice in exchange for the words I gave, and a lot of stories I obviously won't talk about at length. Sometimes it's nice to feel like you're not going at something alone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the advice of my good friend &lt;a href="http://sandymaguire.me/"&gt;Sandy&lt;/a&gt;, I decided to quantify my motivators using a technique called &lt;a href="http://sandymaguire.me/goal-factoring/"&gt;goal-factoring&lt;/a&gt;. He's got an explanation there that's way better than anything I could come up with, but I'll make an attempt:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Start by brainstorming your day-to-day activities. Ideally, this includess any conscious action, but if you can't remember something it's probably not going to factor in too much anyway&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;For each activity, ask yourself &lt;em&gt;why&lt;/em&gt; you do it. Sometimes this makes sense, sometimes it doesn't, but don't stop thinking about it until you come up with at least one cause. In my case, I tried to generalize causes a little at this step to make the map cleaner, but you don't have to&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Until you reach an obvious base level (eg. an emotion, a physical necessity), repeat with remaining roots from the previous step. You can update nodes to point to more base causes as necessary.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He ends up with a chart that (from low-resolution) looks like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Goal-factoring Chart" src="/goalfactoring.jpg" title="Goal-Factoring Chart" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After drawing up my version of the process, I realized it wouldn't make as much sense as a chart for me for 2 reasons:
  * I can't draw. LaTeX? Still won't be readable (somehow). Some other charting software? Ain't nobody got time for that.
  * Mine turns out &lt;em&gt;so damn linear&lt;/em&gt; that it's a very simple ranking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What do I mean by linear? Well it's simple: I came up with some 7 reasons why I do around 20 things I do. Out of these 7, 4 were linear compositions of the other 3. Out of the remaining 3, I could pinpoint some combination of 3 basic emotions. Then I stopped, because, as I said, there isn't much further to go from there, and the mathy part of me realized I'd found what amounted to the rank of my emotional matrix, so I probably wouldn't make further headway anyway.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But then I ran into an issue: &lt;em&gt;what should I do with this information?&lt;/em&gt; I had no idea how to combine some vague sense of self-realization with a desire to write, a personal website, and so much unused creative energy. I thought long and hard on the issue, deliberated for hours, and...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just kidding. The moment I stopped writing out the list, I started thinking through the blog entries. This will be the first of three (if I'm lucky), and simultaneously the most and least upbeat. So here we go.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Pride&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pride gets a bad rap. It's one of the deadly sins. It's associated with conceit, vanity, and self-interest. If you believe Quentin Tarantino, "Pride only hurts. It never helps."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It also makes it possible to define yourself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let me explain with an anecdote of sorts. Back in high school, I used to get around mostly by bike. (I still do, but I used to too.) By Grade 12, I had my route down perfectly: down along the lakeshore for about 7 km, then up one of the steepest hills in the city, then around 2 km more to my school's front entrance. It was a great path, stayed off the road for as long as possible, and had huge benefits for strength and cardio built right in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The waterfront was the hardest part. Large bodies of water tend to generate large air currents from convection, which means shorelines tend to be windy. Add in the fact that Lake Ontario is by no means small, and you get one hell of a windy bike ride. Most curiously, no matter what time I left and in which direction I was headed, the wind usually seemed to be &lt;em&gt;against me&lt;/em&gt;. So what did I do? Simple. I biked &lt;em&gt;harder&lt;/em&gt;. It became so frequent that every time I felt a blast of wind along Lakeshore Boulevard West, I muttered under my breath:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bring it on, motherfucker.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;See, biking is something that I'd used to &lt;em&gt;define&lt;/em&gt; me. If I knew more philosophy, I'd say I considered biking to be &lt;em&gt;essential&lt;/em&gt; to my person. I claimed that route and made it mine. No one did it better. And no wind got in my way. Not backing down became vital to who I was, integrated firmly with my identity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That's the kind of pride I mean. Not the harmful, get-in-your-way kind, but the kind that turns a simple activity like biking a short distance as fast as possible into a defense of your sense of self. The kind of feeling you get that makes you think, "I can't fail at this because it is not in my nature. &lt;em&gt;That is not who I am&lt;/em&gt;."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You may still notice a problem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This kind of pride can screw you over if you do end up failing at something you treasure. Suddenly, you're without part of your identity, and you don't know how to fix that. I'm going to go ahead and push my anecdote as far as I can to give you some tips on that:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Pick your battles. I cannot stress this enough. Sure, biking into the wind made me feel validated because I could do it. But as it got colder? As the wind became less of a gentle, competitive shove and more of a threat on my life? As the streets iced up and the mornings grew dark? I stopped. I put my bike in the shed (&lt;em&gt;cough&lt;/em&gt; hallway &lt;em&gt;coug&lt;/em&gt;) for the winter and went into my yearly trading-coffee-for-morning-rides phase. I knew I couldn't win against the elements, and, besides, I biked first and foremost because it made me feel &lt;em&gt;alive&lt;/em&gt;. Dying in the process wouldn't help anything.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Remind yourself periodically who's in charge. I have some rules about biking, like I try not to bike in the rain, and I avoid biking when I know I'll be out long after dark. Really, though, I just take a break from it every once in a while to remind me that I &lt;em&gt;chose&lt;/em&gt; to make it part of me, not the other way around. Remember, above all else, &lt;em&gt;you define you&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To sum up, let it drive you but keep your foot above the brake and your hands over the steering wheel (like you would with a self-driving car). And when you feel that gust pushing at you the exact moment you were starting to tire, lower your head, grin, and say:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bring it on, motherfucker.&lt;/p&gt;

It's also probably the most honest thing I will ever post on this blog, and easily the least emotionally-restrained. It has a lot of not-well-known info about me and my life that I've never been comfortable sharing. Depending on who you are and how well you know me, it may change the tenor of our interaction, and not necessarily for the better. Stop here if you aren't okay with that, or think I wouldn't be.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Still reading? Alright, you've been warned.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This post is about the effects and truths of depression and related mental illnesses, from a first- and second-hand perspective. I'll start by going over why I have whatever knowledge I do, since otherwise I'd just be talking out my ass. Then I'll go over the most important things to remember about this kind of stuff, basically a fact-or-myth about dealing with depression. I'll finish up with some opinions about more general handling of mental health issues, because what's a blog without opinion?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Background Info&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've never told this to anyone without a medical degree, but in March 2012 I was diagnosed with mild-to-moderate depression. Though this was aggravated by a borderline case of anaemia, there's some evidence to suggest I've been dealing with depression since I was a pre-teen, most notably some hereditary predisposition and, oh yeah, &lt;em&gt;the fact that I'm still suffering from it&lt;/em&gt;. Mild-to-moderate depression is basically what we'd call "high-functioning" if I were an alcoholic: it doesn't strongly affect how I go about my day-to-day life (&lt;em&gt;usually&lt;/em&gt;), but it can still lead to significant problems down the road. What it basically boils down to is&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;little or no motivation to do pretty much anything&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;extremely low social energy at times&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;tendency towards self-defeating thought processes&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;a few other things I won't discuss here because my blog is public&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(I don't want to even fathom the number of people who read that section and went, "&lt;em&gt;Oh.&lt;/em&gt; That explains a lot.")&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why did I never tell anyone? Well, &lt;em&gt;have you met me&lt;/em&gt;? Do I seem like the type to ask outside myself for help? Do I seem like the type to &lt;em&gt;stop and admit that something is wrong&lt;/em&gt;?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I guess I'm doing my best to change that, now. (This post might not stay up forever.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"But Jacob," you might say if you skipped the rest of this section, "you talk about severe depression later on. Surely you can't be as informed about that."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!-- Get this section approved --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I'd respond with this ever-so-slightly more public information. In October 2010, I started dating a wonderful woman named Monica Post. This was somewhat against my better judgement because, while I was almost certain that I was madly in love with her, I was more certain that she was severely depressed, because I'd been one of the people to help her out of a particularly low point. Later we found out that she had Bipolar Disorder, an illness that is characterized by unpredictable shifts between periods of mania (over-confidence, delusions of grandeur, hyperactivity, hallucinations, psychosis, and general emotional instability) and periods of depression (which I described above, except stronger). In a move seen by those who knew as uncharacteristically mature and brave (I don't share this belief), I stayed by her for a little over three years, through the best times and the worst.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I really wish I didn't have to write in past tense. Monica died just under 4 months ago.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Aside:I've never openly written on this subject without some level of control over my audience. My level of "handling it" fluctuates from day to day. On the better days, I want the subject as far away from me as possible. On the worse ones, I'm not strong enough to write about it. This blog post is partially me saying, "Fuck that. I'm stronger than this." (Before you agree with me, keep in mind that I had to write this section in private because I'm shaking like a poorly-built house on a fault line.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So uh yeah. Life experience is a bitch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Facts&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(Or as close to facts as I can get)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First and foremost, something I feel should always be mentioned: depression is mostly about chemical imbalances in the brain. If there's anything that bugs knowledgeable people the most, it's when people say to just "Get over it." Seriously, fuck you. That's like telling a person in a wheelchair to just get up and walk.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now let's go over some treatment methods. The "simplest" treatment is psychotherapy, or, if you're in a lazy work of fiction, "lie down on a couch with a guy who looks like Freud and talk about your mother." The current main school of thought is &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognitive_behavioral_therapy"&gt;Cognitive Behavioural Therapy&lt;/a&gt;, which focuses on harmful thought processes and destructive emotional responses. I say "main", but from what I've experienced I could also easily say "only," because I've never seen any other kind of psychotherapy suggested. In programming terms, CBT (as it's almost always abbreviated) is debugging your mind: constantly thinking, "Why did I think that? Where did that emotional outburst come from? Why am I so affected by this?" Luckily, most people are better at this than &lt;code&gt;gdb&lt;/code&gt;, since it's been shown to be fairly effective on anything short of severe depression (not to mention many other kinds of mental illness.) Hell, I'd say depression-free people can even benefit from it from time to time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But sometimes it just doesn't work. You'd be surprised at how self-defeating a person with depression can be, and sometimes it's just too deeply-rooted in their thought process to be dislodged like that. Or it just takes too much energy, and depression takes enough away on its own. For that, medication is the next best thing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Remember how I said depression is mainly chemicals? See, brains are &lt;em&gt;hard&lt;/em&gt;. There's so much that can go wrong, and, even when it looks like the same thing is wrong in two people, they may not be helped by the same thing. Again, in CS-y terms, it's like supporting an Android app on every phone: there are so many subtle differences in hardware and the implementation of software that a bugfix on one platform is nowhere near guaranteed to work on all others. Hell, it might make things &lt;em&gt;worse&lt;/em&gt;. That's why there are so many anti-depressants out there, and that's why some people spend their entire life finding the right one. (Ignore the implications of the wording. That's not what I meant.) Prozac might work for you, or it might make you more suicidal. Effexor might make you a little brighter, or it might numb your emotions. Cymbalta might make you more stable or (also likely) less. But, of course, SSRIs don't work that fast, so you won't know until 4 weeks in, and by then you'll be experiencing all the &lt;em&gt;negative&lt;/em&gt; side-effects, and you'll probably go through withdrawal if it turns out it wasn't even working. Then you just repeat the process the next time you can see your psychiatrist, because, wow, it looks like they're booked &lt;em&gt;through until December&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sorry, that's a bit of a raw nerve. Back on topic...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are more extreme cures and fixes than medication and thought-correction, but I won't go into them here because I &lt;em&gt;won't&lt;/em&gt; be able to write about them while staying in a stable frame of mind. There are also less-extreme things that help. A huge factor, for instance, is proper physical health. I've noticed personally that it's easier to handle my symptoms when I've been keeping up a healthy routine of diet and exercise (though maintaining that through an episode isn't easy, to say the least). Obviously this isn't a cure, since the episodes still happen, but it has been shown to improve the stress reaction, which I think is the most important factor in getting through it. (&lt;a href="http://www.webmd.com/depression/guide/exercise-depression"&gt;Source&lt;/a&gt;) To put this in nerd-terms, this goes about as far towards computer performance as keeping your fan free of dust: it won't fix a crashed hard-drive, but it'll help out at times.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Opinion&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Where to begin?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let's start off at the obvious: please treat people with depression (and any other mental illness) as &lt;em&gt;people&lt;/em&gt;. Like, they aren't animals in a zoo or something, nor are they that mask of tragedy that hangs along its creepy-smile companion over every middle school drama department. They have just as much depth to their emotional state as any other person, and they &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; don't like to be labelled. I know the party-line is always about "removing stigma," but I feel like a lot of people who talk like that do very little to actually &lt;em&gt;remove&lt;/em&gt; it, and in some ways actually &lt;em&gt;further&lt;/em&gt; it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On that note, the idea of a "mental health rally?" Stop. The last thing a depressed person wants is to be reminded of it in public. Further, you're making a social event &lt;em&gt;for people with no energy for social activity&lt;/em&gt;. How does that make sense? Making people aware of resources available to them is one thing. Pointing out what's &lt;em&gt;wrong&lt;/em&gt; in a public setting is another.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you're having trouble, &lt;em&gt;see a therapist at least once&lt;/em&gt;. I'm not saying to sign up for 10 sessions, just see if it helps and go from there. If you want a resource on CBT for some self-study, I found &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/Mind-Over-Mood-Change-Changing/dp/0898621283"&gt;Mind over Mood&lt;/a&gt; to be pretty helpful. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lastly, don't suffer in silence. Don't wait 10 years to tell your family you think something is wrong. Maybe don't blog about it, but talking to someone, &lt;em&gt;anyone&lt;/em&gt;, will help, trust me. I'm probably pushing the blog-barrier again, but that's one of the things I miss most, which is likely why I'm writing about it now, as opposed to months ago.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Happy 3rd post! I'm going to go sit in my room for a while.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Later,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;J&lt;/p&gt;</summary><category term="personal"></category><category term="mental health"></category><category term="heavy"></category></entry><entry><title>Eulogy</title><link href="http://jabrahams.ca/eulogy.html" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2013-11-18T00:00:00Z</updated><author><name>Jacob Abrahams</name></author><id>tag:jabrahams.ca,2013-11-18:eulogy.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;(&lt;strong&gt;Note: I've re-dated this article so it doesn't turn up at the top of the page anymore. As you might tell from context, it was written a year after the publish date. Sorry for the confusion.&lt;/strong&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I never really did say a proper eulogy for Monica. I mean, sure, I said something at the service, and I guess it sufficed. I couldn't &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt;, not after what I'd shared with her, not with the raw pain I felt that day. My memory's a little broken (like everything else), but I remember bits and pieces of what I said, or set out to say, with my already-lacking public speaking skill set ever lower by circumstance. Something about having hoped to gather everyone in a church for a much happier reason. Something about how she'd lit up everyone's life. Something about her insisting on making gingerbread at 2AM one night when were supposed to be packing to leave our apartment for two weeks. Something about making too much gingerbread dough and most of it going bad.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But I can do better. I'm a writer, after all, not a speaker. It's only a year late.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let me first share a story that was shared with me a few years back. This is way back, around the time Monica was 3 or 4 if I recall correctly. Her family was on vacation somewhere seaside, and her mom was watching over her somewhere on a beach. And Monica was intent on swimming. "Monica swim," she insisted. No, she was told, you're too little. "Monica swim," she replied, adamant. No, she was instructed, you'll fall. "Monica swim," she said one last time, and walked off to the water. Of course, she immediately fell in, but her mom was right there to pluck her out of the water to safety. As she spat out the saltwater, she had one last thing to say: "Monica no swim."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think this shows the first thing a lot of people notice about her. Even when she was too young to understand grammar or tides, she still had this &lt;em&gt;determination&lt;/em&gt; to do what she thought needed to be done. She was one of the most determined people I knew, rarely letting anything get in the way of her goals. Sometimes, sure, she'd get in over her head, but she always managed to get plucked out out of the water.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I think of the Monica I knew, the woman she was with me, the memories that stick with me are always the same. Sometimes, when she was feeling sad or anxious, she'd lay her head in my lap and ask me to stroke her hair until she fell asleep. I can still feel the back of her head across my thighs, her soft hair around my fingertips. In my dreams, I can still see the look in her eyes change from distressed to calm to restful, still feel the love in them behind it all as she gazed up at me. I'd usually start to fall asleep before she would, so we usually wouldn't stay like that. She asked me once if I was bored of it, but the problem was the complete opposite: looking down at her, as I held her safe, I couldn't help but be at peace with the world, because no matter what, there was at least one thing right with it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think the phrase "better half" is overused when it comes to significant others, but I firmly believe it here: she was the missing piece of my two-piece puzzle, and she was definitely the better piece. I can't even begin to describe what she was to me, what she was to others, without feeling like I'm repeating myself. Everything she was part of felt better for it. She brought a vibrancy and energy I can't even comprehend to everything she did. She cared genuinely, and rarely if ever had a bad thing to say about anyone. She was always on the move, always curious about the next thing, always dreaming up new ideas and scheming new plans, and I loved her so much for it. I could share a thousand more stories, each one more and more &lt;em&gt;her&lt;/em&gt;, because there was always a new thing to be done, a new journey to be started, and I'm just so grateful for being taken along on every single one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That she was so friendly and caring and loving was something special in itself, but that she was all that despite the hand life had dealt her, despite her circumstance and struggles, was absolutely unheard of. Not only did the world lose a bright light the day she died, it lost one that was all the brighter for the darkness that surrounded it, and I don't think it can ever truly recover that. I think a little bit of everyone that knew her died when they heard. For some of us, it was more than a little. The world is a painful place indeed when the images and thoughts you once looked to for strength, for comfort, for support, now only offer a profound agony cutting through the core of your being. I never knew I could love someone so much that it would hurt this bad when I lost them, but that's just the kind of person Monica was, and that's just the effect she had on people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This will never be enough. There will never be enough words to express what she was to me, what she was to our family, what she was to her friends and mine. I could never run through all the stories we lived during our time together, the eternities we shared in our few, far-too-short years together. But I hope this is enough to remind those who knew her of their own Monica stories, of their own memories of times with her. And I hope it's enough for those who didn't know her to understand what the rest of us are missing, why we hurt so bad even a year later. And I hope it'd be enough for her.&lt;/p&gt;
