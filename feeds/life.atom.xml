It's also probably the most honest thing I will ever post on this blog, and easily the least emotionally-restrained. It has a lot of not-well-known info about me and my life that I've never been comfortable sharing. Depending on who you are and how well you know me, it may change the tenor of our interaction, and not necessarily for the better. Stop here if you aren't okay with that, or think I wouldn't be.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Still reading? Alright, you've been warned.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This post is about the effects and truths of depression and related mental illnesses, from a first- and second-hand perspective. I'll start by going over why I have whatever knowledge I do, since otherwise I'd just be talking out my ass. Then I'll go over the most important things to remember about this kind of stuff, basically a fact-or-myth about dealing with depression. I'll finish up with some opinions about more general handling of mental health issues, because what's a blog without opinion?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Background Info&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've never told this to anyone without a medical degree, but in March 2012 I was diagnosed with mild-to-moderate depression. Though this was aggravated by a borderline case of anaemia, there's some evidence to suggest I've been dealing with depression since I was a pre-teen, most notably some hereditary predisposition and, oh yeah, &lt;em&gt;the fact that I'm still suffering from it&lt;/em&gt;. Mild-to-moderate depression is basically what we'd call "high-functioning" if I were an alcoholic: it doesn't strongly affect how I go about my day-to-day life (&lt;em&gt;usually&lt;/em&gt;), but it can still lead to significant problems down the road. What it basically boils down to is&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;little or no motivation to do pretty much anything&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;extremely low social energy at times&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;tendency towards self-defeating thought processes&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;a few other things I won't discuss here because my blog is public&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(I don't want to even fathom the number of people who read that section and went, "&lt;em&gt;Oh.&lt;/em&gt; That explains a lot.")&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why did I never tell anyone? Well, &lt;em&gt;have you met me&lt;/em&gt;? Do I seem like the type to ask outside myself for help? Do I seem like the type to &lt;em&gt;stop and admit that something is wrong&lt;/em&gt;?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I guess I'm doing my best to change that, now. (This post might not stay up forever.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"But Jacob," you might say if you skipped the rest of this section, "you talk about severe depression later on. Surely you can't be as informed about that."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!-- Get this section approved --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I'd respond with this ever-so-slightly more public information. In October 2010, I started dating a wonderful woman named Monica Post. This was somewhat against my better judgement because, while I was almost certain that I was madly in love with her, I was more certain that she was severely depressed, because I'd been one of the people to help her out of a particularly low point. Later we found out that she had Bipolar Disorder, an illness that is characterized by unpredictable shifts between periods of mania (over-confidence, delusions of grandeur, hyperactivity, hallucinations, psychosis, and general emotional instability) and periods of depression (which I described above, except stronger). In a move seen by those who knew as uncharacteristically mature and brave (I don't share this belief), I stayed by her for a little over three years, through the best times and the worst.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I really wish I didn't have to write in past tense. Monica died just under 4 months ago.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Aside:I've never openly written on this subject without some level of control over my audience. My level of "handling it" fluctuates from day to day. On the better days, I want the subject as far away from me as possible. On the worse ones, I'm not strong enough to write about it. This blog post is partially me saying, "Fuck that. I'm stronger than this." (Before you agree with me, keep in mind that I had to write this section in private because I'm shaking like a poorly-built house on a fault line.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So uh yeah. Life experience is a bitch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Facts&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(Or as close to facts as I can get)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First and foremost, something I feel should always be mentioned: depression is mostly about chemical imbalances in the brain. If there's anything that bugs knowledgeable people the most, it's when people say to just "Get over it." Seriously, fuck you. That's like telling a person in a wheelchair to just get up and walk.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now let's go over some treatment methods. The "simplest" treatment is psychotherapy, or, if you're in a lazy work of fiction, "lie down on a couch with a guy who looks like Freud and talk about your mother." The current main school of thought is &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognitive_behavioral_therapy"&gt;Cognitive Behavioural Therapy&lt;/a&gt;, which focuses on harmful thought processes and destructive emotional responses. I say "main", but from what I've experienced I could also easily say "only," because I've never seen any other kind of psychotherapy suggested. In programming terms, CBT (as it's almost always abbreviated) is debugging your mind: constantly thinking, "Why did I think that? Where did that emotional outburst come from? Why am I so affected by this?" Luckily, most people are better at this than &lt;code&gt;gdb&lt;/code&gt;, since it's been shown to be fairly effective on anything short of severe depression (not to mention many other kinds of mental illness.) Hell, I'd say depression-free people can even benefit from it from time to time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But sometimes it just doesn't work. You'd be surprised at how self-defeating a person with depression can be, and sometimes it's just too deeply-rooted in their thought process to be dislodged like that. Or it just takes too much energy, and depression takes enough away on its own. For that, medication is the next best thing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Remember how I said depression is mainly chemicals? See, brains are &lt;em&gt;hard&lt;/em&gt;. There's so much that can go wrong, and, even when it looks like the same thing is wrong in two people, they may not be helped by the same thing. Again, in CS-y terms, it's like supporting an Android app on every phone: there are so many subtle differences in hardware and the implementation of software that a bugfix on one platform is nowhere near guaranteed to work on all others. Hell, it might make things &lt;em&gt;worse&lt;/em&gt;. That's why there are so many anti-depressants out there, and that's why some people spend their entire life finding the right one. (Ignore the implications of the wording. That's not what I meant.) Prozac might work for you, or it might make you more suicidal. Effexor might make you a little brighter, or it might numb your emotions. Cymbalta might make you more stable or (also likely) less. But, of course, SSRIs don't work that fast, so you won't know until 4 weeks in, and by then you'll be experiencing all the &lt;em&gt;negative&lt;/em&gt; side-effects, and you'll probably go through withdrawal if it turns out it wasn't even working. Then you just repeat the process the next time you can see your psychiatrist, because, wow, it looks like they're booked &lt;em&gt;through until December&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sorry, that's a bit of a raw nerve. Back on topic...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are more extreme cures and fixes than medication and thought-correction, but I won't go into them here because I &lt;em&gt;won't&lt;/em&gt; be able to write about them while staying in a stable frame of mind. There are also less-extreme things that help. A huge factor, for instance, is proper physical health. I've noticed personally that it's easier to handle my symptoms when I've been keeping up a healthy routine of diet and exercise (though maintaining that through an episode isn't easy, to say the least). Obviously this isn't a cure, since the episodes still happen, but it has been shown to improve the stress reaction, which I think is the most important factor in getting through it. (&lt;a href="http://www.webmd.com/depression/guide/exercise-depression"&gt;Source&lt;/a&gt;) To put this in nerd-terms, this goes about as far towards computer performance as keeping your fan free of dust: it won't fix a crashed hard-drive, but it'll help out at times.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Opinion&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Where to begin?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let's start off at the obvious: please treat people with depression (and any other mental illness) as &lt;em&gt;people&lt;/em&gt;. Like, they aren't animals in a zoo or something, nor are they that mask of tragedy that hangs along its creepy-smile companion over every middle school drama department. They have just as much depth to their emotional state as any other person, and they &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; don't like to be labelled. I know the party-line is always about "removing stigma," but I feel like a lot of people who talk like that do very little to actually &lt;em&gt;remove&lt;/em&gt; it, and in some ways actually &lt;em&gt;further&lt;/em&gt; it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On that note, the idea of a "mental health rally?" Stop. The last thing a depressed person wants is to be reminded of it in public. Further, you're making a social event &lt;em&gt;for people with no energy for social activity&lt;/em&gt;. How does that make sense? Making people aware of resources available to them is one thing. Pointing out what's &lt;em&gt;wrong&lt;/em&gt; in a public setting is another.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you're having trouble, &lt;em&gt;see a therapist at least once&lt;/em&gt;. I'm not saying to sign up for 10 sessions, just see if it helps and go from there. If you want a resource on CBT for some self-study, I found &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/Mind-Over-Mood-Change-Changing/dp/0898621283"&gt;Mind over Mood&lt;/a&gt; to be pretty helpful. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lastly, don't suffer in silence. Don't wait 10 years to tell your family you think something is wrong. Maybe don't blog about it, but talking to someone, &lt;em&gt;anyone&lt;/em&gt;, will help, trust me. I'm probably pushing the blog-barrier again, but that's one of the things I miss most, which is likely why I'm writing about it now, as opposed to months ago.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Happy 3rd post! I'm going to go sit in my room for a while.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Later,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;J&lt;/p&gt;</summary><category term="personal"></category><category term="mental health"></category><category term="heavy"></category></entry><entry><title>Eulogy</title><link href="http://jabrahams.ca/eulogy.html" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2013-11-18T00:00:00Z</updated><author><name>Jacob Abrahams</name></author><id>tag:jabrahams.ca,2013-11-18:eulogy.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;(&lt;strong&gt;Note: I've re-dated this article so it doesn't turn up at the top of the page anymore. As you might tell from context, it was written a year after the publish date. Sorry for the confusion.&lt;/strong&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I never really did say a proper eulogy for Monica. I mean, sure, I said something at the service, and I guess it sufficed. I couldn't &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt;, not after what I'd shared with her, not with the raw pain I felt that day. My memory's a little broken (like everything else), but I remember bits and pieces of what I said, or set out to say, with my already-lacking public speaking skill set ever lower by circumstance. Something about having hoped to gather everyone in a church for a much happier reason. Something about how she'd lit up everyone's life. Something about her insisting on making gingerbread at 2AM one night when were supposed to be packing to leave our apartment for two weeks. Something about making too much gingerbread dough and most of it going bad.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But I can do better. I'm a writer, after all, not a speaker. It's only a year late.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let me first share a story that was shared with me a few years back. This is way back, around the time Monica was 3 or 4 if I recall correctly. Her family was on vacation somewhere seaside, and her mom was watching over her somewhere on a beach. And Monica was intent on swimming. "Monica swim," she insisted. No, she was told, you're too little. "Monica swim," she replied, adamant. No, she was instructed, you'll fall. "Monica swim," she said one last time, and walked off to the water. Of course, she immediately fell in, but her mom was right there to pluck her out of the water to safety. As she spat out the saltwater, she had one last thing to say: "Monica no swim."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think this shows the first thing a lot of people notice about her. Even when she was too young to understand grammar or tides, she still had this &lt;em&gt;determination&lt;/em&gt; to do what she thought needed to be done. She was one of the most determined people I knew, rarely letting anything get in the way of her goals. Sometimes, sure, she'd get in over her head, but she always managed to get plucked out out of the water.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I think of the Monica I knew, the woman she was with me, the memories that stick with me are always the same. Sometimes, when she was feeling sad or anxious, she'd lay her head in my lap and ask me to stroke her hair until she fell asleep. I can still feel the back of her head across my thighs, her soft hair around my fingertips. In my dreams, I can still see the look in her eyes change from distressed to calm to restful, still feel the love in them behind it all as she gazed up at me. I'd usually start to fall asleep before she would, so we usually wouldn't stay like that. She asked me once if I was bored of it, but the problem was the complete opposite: looking down at her, as I held her safe, I couldn't help but be at peace with the world, because no matter what, there was at least one thing right with it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think the phrase "better half" is overused when it comes to significant others, but I firmly believe it here: she was the missing piece of my two-piece puzzle, and she was definitely the better piece. I can't even begin to describe what she was to me, what she was to others, without feeling like I'm repeating myself. Everything she was part of felt better for it. She brought a vibrancy and energy I can't even comprehend to everything she did. She cared genuinely, and rarely if ever had a bad thing to say about anyone. She was always on the move, always curious about the next thing, always dreaming up new ideas and scheming new plans, and I loved her so much for it. I could share a thousand more stories, each one more and more &lt;em&gt;her&lt;/em&gt;, because there was always a new thing to be done, a new journey to be started, and I'm just so grateful for being taken along on every single one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That she was so friendly and caring and loving was something special in itself, but that she was all that despite the hand life had dealt her, despite her circumstance and struggles, was absolutely unheard of. Not only did the world lose a bright light the day she died, it lost one that was all the brighter for the darkness that surrounded it, and I don't think it can ever truly recover that. I think a little bit of everyone that knew her died when they heard. For some of us, it was more than a little. The world is a painful place indeed when the images and thoughts you once looked to for strength, for comfort, for support, now only offer a profound agony cutting through the core of your being. I never knew I could love someone so much that it would hurt this bad when I lost them, but that's just the kind of person Monica was, and that's just the effect she had on people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This will never be enough. There will never be enough words to express what she was to me, what she was to our family, what she was to her friends and mine. I could never run through all the stories we lived during our time together, the eternities we shared in our few, far-too-short years together. But I hope this is enough to remind those who knew her of their own Monica stories, of their own memories of times with her. And I hope it's enough for those who didn't know her to understand what the rest of us are missing, why we hurt so bad even a year later. And I hope it'd be enough for her.&lt;/p&gt;
