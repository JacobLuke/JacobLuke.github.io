</footer><!-- /.post-info -->      <p>I don't think I have a relationship with anything in the realm of software engineering so vitriolic and amorous and unstable as my love-hate feud with Python. I have a strong distaste for Java tempered by respect for design choices. I have a wary friendship with C++, using it when I can but always keeping my eye on it, never trusting it to do the right thing when I'm not watching. I begrudgingly use Javascript when I have little other choice, its <em>lingua franca</em> status forming a teleological argument against the divine.</p>
<p>But Python? Python's different.</p>
<p>It's my best frenemy. I use it for so much: personal projects, <a href="pelican.html">this blog</a>, and even instead of a calculator more often than not. It's the first thing at my fingers for prototyping and simple calculations, and I would doubtlessly waste endless hours without it.</p>
<p>And Python is <em>wrong</em>.</p>
<p>Sure, whitespace indentation is nice...if you're looking at it. But what if you're blind? Suddenly, you have to be Rainman to figure out scope, keeping track of whether your screenreader said "space" 6 times, 8 times, or 22, and when the last time it said that number was. Even if you can see, it can be a total pain to track down a SyntaxError caused by an unmatched dedent you can't find <em>because of course it's invisible</em>.</p>
<p>Okay, fine, so maybe you can make do, decide on a team standard for a prime number of spaces per indent to make it easy to keep track of where your scope begins and ends. Then you're programming along, creating <code>Foo</code>s and <code>Bar</code>s and passing them along to God-knows-what functions and methods. Then suddenly you get an <code>AttributeError</code> in some obscure code path with an inexplicable message like <code>object of type Foo has no attribute intValue</code> and you're wondering how it happened, since that doesn't even <em>follow</em> your naming convention (let alone Python's), then you reconsider your usage that doesn't allow or encourage type-checking. (I think everyone goes through this moment at least once in their Python career.)</p>
<p>Don't get me wrong, duck-typing is great when you want to pass things along that have the same interface but aren't strict subclasses. As the canonical example goes, if it <code>quack</code>s like a duck and <code>walk</code>s like a duck, then it's a duck. But then suddenly you get an object that refuses to <code>walk</code> unless you call <code>caffeinate</code> first, and for whom <code>quack</code> isn't even a function but a collection of works by Kerouac, and you realize rapidly that a language that lets a program pass a confused philosophy undergraduate where a duck is expected is not necessarily designed for stability and robustness.</p>
<p>So you stop coding functions and start making classes, because by golly Python's class syntax is clear and concise. You define your <code>__init__</code> to construct your <code>Thingamajig</code>s, and, when you decide you need more control over allocation, you also define your <code>__new__</code>, because why not have two separate constructors? Then you realize that your <code>Thingamajig</code>s are actually <code>instance</code>s because this is Python 2 and you forgot to subclass <code>object</code>, and <em>of course you wouldn't want objects to be created from classes</em>. You define your <code>__str__</code> for when you want to print <code>Thingamajigs</code> to the console, and your <code>__repr__</code> for...um...when you want to pass it to <code>eval</code>? Then you want <code>Thingamajig</code>s to have pointer-like behaviour in <code>if</code> statements, so you define <code>__bool__</code>. But that doesn't work (except when you use a 3.x interpreter) and your objects are always True, so you look into the docs and realize you have to define <code>__nonzero__</code>, because consistent naming conventions <em>are apparently not a thing in Python</em>.</p>
<p>Once you've got your thingamajigs, you can manipulate the base class as you please, since it's just a special instance of a <code>type</code> object. This might sound familiar if you've spent extensive time programming with Javascript's prototype-based model, in which case dollar signs likely bring to mind not hordes and hordes of money but nightmares of clumpy, irregular, unstable frameworks making a bad problem worse in unpredictable and subtle ways. You probably feel right at home here, actually.</p>
