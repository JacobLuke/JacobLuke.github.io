<p>I'll admit I'm self-reliant to a fault. Take, for example, the earlier two parts of this series. The first was all about relying on your self-image to find purpose, basing your strength in your own identity. The second was about doing justice to your own experiences, allowing you to draw power from your own deserved characteristics. </p>
<p>It sounds great in theory, but I've found (on multiple occasions) that independence and self-isolation go hand in hand, making me less likely to reach out in times of need. Starting this blog, admittedly, was an attempt to break from that: my <a href="failsafes.html">first real article</a> is kind of transparent in hindsight about its true intentions. I kind of wish I'd kept that spirit up, but sometimes old habits are easier. It's often simplest to think you're the only thing riding on your decisions, pruning goals down to a clear objective and reducing the weight of success and failure.</p>
<p>But it's never true.</p>
<p>Just like you owe your own life experiences due diligence, you have a duty to those who care for you to thrive, to make your life the best you can. They've invested what they could, and they all deserve the dividends you can provide. </p>
<p>I don't mean to say that others should live your life for you, or make your choices on your behalf, or ever push you to do something you don't think you should. Hell no. Make your own damn life, it's the only one you'll get. </p>
<p>At the same time, though, remember all the people who've taken stake in you. Every person who's said, "That guy. I think he'll do okay, and I'll help make sure." Every person who stood by you, with you, or for you. Every person who cleaned your wounds, visible or not. Every person who put their faith in you at a time where nothing mattered more. You owe them something. Not money, not children, not the blood of your enemies. You don't even owe them success, fame, or fortune. You just owe them one thing: when everything gets rough, you hold on just a little longer. You stand just a few seconds more when the storm hits, keep the levees together for just a few more moments for the brick and mortar they gave you to build them. </p>
<p>And maybe, just maybe, they make the difference, and you keep running when you should have stumbled and fell. When you have no right to survival, you thrive. When you couldn't possibly imagine going on another week, another day, another <em>hour</em>, you do.</p>
<p>And you never forget why.</p>

<p><strong>Postscript</strong></p>
<p>I'd originally intended for this article to focus on empathy, all those months ago when I conceived it. The main message was the same, of course, but the delivery was <em>totally</em> different. It was mostly about pain transference, about the multiplier you'd apply to your own suffering to pass it off to someone else. It was something that often went through my head at my darker moments, for reasons that are left as an exercise to the reader. </p>
<p>It helped a <em>lot</em> (more than any other CBT-like thought process has in ages), but I realized something when writing the first draft of this article: it was very <em>me</em>. It's not like it could <em>never</em> help someone else, (hell, none of my experiences are wholly unique) but it certainly limited my scope immensely. So I retooled. And retooled. And retooled. And eventually wrote an article that you probably just read. It's different, but it gets the same message across (more or less) without losing the effect (I hope) or being inaccessible to people who haven't been in a state like I was.</p><p>There are <a href="http://jabrahams.ca/respect-2.html#disqus_thread">comments</a>.</p>                </article>
